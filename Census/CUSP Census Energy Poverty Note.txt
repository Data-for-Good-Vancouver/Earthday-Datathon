WHAT IS ENERGY POVERTY?
Energy poverty refers to the experience of households or communities that struggle to heat and cool their homes and power their lights and appliances. Those in this situation face multiple challenges and impacts, including:

Discomfort from living in cold and drafty homes.
Disruptions from abrupt utility shutoffs, such as inability to cook and spoiled food.
Sacrificing other essentials such as groceries and medication in order to keep up with energy bills.
Increased incidence of respiratory illness in children and infants
Higher stress and poor mental health outcomes for adults.
Difficulty participating fully in community life.
